                        Hello! My name is MÃ¡ximo and I enjoy creating technological things, sharing knowledge and providing solutions to people.
                        My interest in technology began in 2005 when, at the age of 12,
                        installing and testing the programs that people downloaded in Internet cafes,
                        I learned how to manage one and disassembled my personal computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At 16 I went to live in another city to begin my studies in computer science (UTU) and after that
                        I moved to another city to finish "Technologist in Informatics" in Montevideo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had the privilege of working as technical support for approximately 300 restaurants and later as
                        remote support and GeneXus developer in one of the most prestigious hospitals in Uruguay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently living my dream working with technologies
                        such as ReactJs, NextJs and Java at a financial company (Paigo).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And, not less important <b>I really love coffee :D</b>
                    </p>
                </div>
